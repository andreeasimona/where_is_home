# Where is home

Nowadays people are traveling and moving to other countries more then ever. There are many factors that you have to take in account when you decide to relocate somewhere else.
There are so many surveys with diffrent topics. The same region is not the best fit for everyone. I been trying for a while now, to look for the best places to relocate. With that in mind, I read a lot of blogs and pools. I realize that none was ofering me a global view of only the things and criteria I was looking for. This project will try to give based of one preferenes the best places to live.
